  - x86 support added to InorderSimicsFeeder and UniFlex (in-order only)
    build with "make UniFlex-x86"
  - Fixed incorrect default configuration settings in UniFlex and UniFlex.OoO
    that could lead to Cache assertions when running self-modifying code

  - Add the no-timing simulators TraceFlex and TraceCMPFlex for checkpoint
    creation and rapid cache studies.  150x faster than OoO!
  - Add DSMFlex and distributed shared memory components to public release
  - Enhanced debug support.  You can now filter debug messages based on
    category and source component from the Simics console. See the help text
    for flexus.debug-* in Simics.

    stat-sample tools that combine measurement regions within a stats file,
    and produce aggregate statistics/confidence intervals across stats files
    for sampled simulations.
